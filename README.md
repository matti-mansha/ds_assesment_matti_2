# Task 2

We want to test your ability to research and solve a problem.

Steps:

1. Import sales_data_sample.csv into panda and create a dataframe
2. Make a flask api that we can ask natural language question and we can give back a human answer based on the data in your dataframe. You decide which algorithm you would you and explain why.

For example:
What is my top earning sale item?

Which city has my best sales?

3. I want you to make a simple filtering flask api that given an order, you can tell if customer is male or female. So pass in the order id and get gender back.

4. I want you to make a simple recommendation engine where user can pass in a month to the flask api and get back a recommendation for a trend happening or anomaly in that month.
